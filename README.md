# Paradise Nursery Shopping Application

This is the front end of a "Paradise Nursery" shopping application, built using React and Redux Toolkit. It allows users to browse a variety of houseplants and add them to a shopping cart. The shopping cart feature lets you see all your items, their total cost, and allows you to adjust the number of items before checking out.

It features:
- A landing page with an attractive background and company details.
- A product listing page with at least 6 houseplants for sale, grouped into 3 categories.
- A functional shopping cart page powered by Redux for state management, letting users increment, decrement, or remove plants.
- A responsive layout using React components and modern CSS techniques.

## How to run
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

Enjoy building your own indoor garden!
